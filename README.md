## Inspiration
As someone with multiple credit cards its hard to determine which card I should use and where. 💳💳 I have also always wanted to know what reward areas my cards were covering and what cards I could get to improve my rewards coverage. That's why we made NicheCard, to find that niche credit card for your collection to help users earn more rewards and save more money as a sort of credit card arbitrage.

## What it does
It aggregates data on top credit cards and allows users to add credit cards to their collection and get a full ai breakdown/overview with recommendations on how/when to use each card and what specific cards the user should get next based on each cards reward systems. 🔥🔥🔥

## How we built it
We built the NicheCard website primarily using Javascript and React. Our NicheAI Analyzer is built using Node.js and utilizes ChatGPT 5 nano LLM to make card comparison breakdowns for the user. We also utilized an opensource api to collect data on 170+ of the worlds most popular credit cards.

## Why the name?
We like to think we're niche, plus we like matcha. 🍵🍵🍵

## Challenges we ran into
Our main challenge was debugging calls to the two different APIs we utilized for the project. 🤬🤬 We also had to learn a lot about frontend development during the project, especially the React framework. 🤕🫩🫩

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the final product and feel accomplished that we were able to deploy it publicly for others to access instead of just running it locally. For a team of two who went in with pretty low expectations the project turned out pretty good. ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 We also had a lot of fun. ❤️‍🔥

## What we learned
We learned a lot about frontend development with React and Javascript. 😭😭😭 We also learned how to implement an LLM AI assistant into a project.

## What's next for NicheCard
There were a bunch of features we wanted to add but didn't get to such as: -Head to Head comparisons -AI overviews for each card -Survey Preferences/Recommendations

Also thank you to the organizers who hosted a fun event. 🥹🥹
